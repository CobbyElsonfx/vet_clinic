# Vet Clinic curriculum-databases-projects-template



## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

<!-- FAQ (optional) -->

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

> Add at least 2 questions new developers would ask when they decide to use your project.

- **[Do I have to use pgAdmin or the SQL shell for PostgreSQL commands]**

  - [You are allowed to choose any of them base on you preference]

- **[Is PostgreSQl the same as SQL ]**

  - [
No, PostgreSQL is not the same as SQL. PostgreSQL and SQL are related but distinct concepts:, PostgreSQL is an RDBMS that uses SQL as its primary language for interacting with the database. SQL, on the other hand, is a standardized language for managing and querying relational databases, and it can be used with various database systems, including PostgreSQL.]
